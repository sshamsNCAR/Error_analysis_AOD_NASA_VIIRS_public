updates:
#in makefile I have updated how to get the libraries
HDF5_INC=$(shell nc-config --includedir)
HDF5_LIB=$(shell nc-config --libdir)
NETCDF4_INC=$(shell nc-config --includedir)
NETCDF4_LIB=$(shell nc-config --libdir)


Steps:
Cd to MatchupCode_NASA_DT (or DB)
mkdir ../Bin
Make (# to compile the code and executable will be in ../Bin)
Module restore MYENV (if error libraries are not loaded)
make (again after module restore, if it did not work the first time) 
ls ../Bin/match_viirs_dt_n20

you need to also create inputs and adjustments as bellow , at the end ./Bin/run match_viirs_dt_n20 yyyy mm dd

Cd AER_VIIRS_EPS_Match.h
	update path
	#define AERONET_PATH "../Data/AERONET/"
	#define AOD_PATH "/data/data314/hliu/DATA/VIIRS_NASA/AERDT_L2_VIIRS_NOAA20/"

I have created batch job to run the code for all days 
batchrun.sh (which creates the station_location.txt for each day and then run the AER_VIIRS_EPS_Match.h)
batchjon_run.pbs (and to use a computational node)

Download all aeronet data from 
https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/download_all_v3_inversions.html

Then I created a python code that convert .lv15 for each station into the format that code is looking for, which is for each day had the station name in yyyy/day/ directory format (/glade/campaign/acom/acom-da/SERVIR/ind-obs/aeronet/AOD_Level15_All_Points_V3/for/)

The C++ code need a text file which has the meta dta of the location of AERONET,
I have created a python code which filter all aeronet staion from nasa site ('https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/aeronet_locations.txt')
based on defined location and then based on thier availibilites and create the final text file for us.
/glade/u/home/sshams/code/AFRICA_SERVIR/aeronet_site_selection_comp_prepare.ipynb

"aeronet_stations_africa_2021_2025.txt"
copy that file into what C++ code is looking for "aeronet_locations.txt"
cp aeronet_stations_africa_2021_2025.txt aeronet_locations.txt  



#Downloading VIIRS data
we have a python tool which allows downloading VIIRS data from NASA or NOAA and any data products,
/glade/campaign/acom/acom-da/SERVIR/VIIRS/python_download_buffer/cmrfetch_eosdis.bash (example: ./cmrfetch_eosdis.bash 2022 01 01 365)
yaml input file are in ../namelist_scripts which can be set with geopgraphical domain and the data products
